An arcane scepter is a [spell](../spells/spells) casting weapon that has 9 additional monster variants. 
Each [scepter](../scepters/scepters) has both a spell that can be cast on attack and a spell that is casted when the item is used.


## Obtaining

### Crafting

The arcane scepter can only be obtained by [crafting](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Crafting) a [scepter](scepter) with and a [lapis lazuli](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Lapis_Lazuli).

## Usage

### Experience

The arcane scepter can store and release [experience](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Experience) by using it. 
Each time it is used a base value of 7 experience is transfered from the player into the scepter.
In case the player does not have enough experience to transfer the scepter can discharge experience to the player.
The amount transfered when using the scepter is modified by the [insight](./insight) enchantment.

### Durability

Using the scepter costs 1 [durability](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Durability). 
When the item breaks it will release all stored experience as [orbs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Experience#Experience_orbs) 
and be replaced by a [scepter](scepter), which can be crafted back into an arcane scepter. 
The [scepter](scepter) will keep the enchantments of the broken arcane scepter.

### Crafting Ingredient

The arcane scepter can be used to craft [Botte o' Enchanting](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bottle_o%27_Enchanting) using 7 experience that is stored.
