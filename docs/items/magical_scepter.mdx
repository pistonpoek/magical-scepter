A magical scepter is a [spell](../spells/spells) casting weapon that has 9 additional monster variants. 
Each [scepter](../scepters/scepters) has both a spell that can be cast on attack and a spell that is casted when the item is used.

## Obtaining

### Crafting

The magical scepter can be [crafted](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Crafting) using a [scepter](scepter), [lapis lazuli](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Lapis_Lazuli) and a [brown mushroom](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Brown_Mushroom).

### Generated Loot

The [old taiga cabin](../structures/old_taiga_cabin) structure contains a chest with loot that always has either a [scepter](scepter) or a magical scepter. 
| Item    | Stack size | Weight | Chance |
| ------- | ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| [<Asset width={16} height={16} location="magicalscepter:scepter" title="Scepter" /> Scepter](../items/scepter) | 1 | 5 / 7 | 71.4% |
| **<Asset width={16} height={16} location="magicalscepter:magical_scepter" title="Magical Scepter" /> Magical Scepter** | 1 | 2 / 7 | 28.6% |


### Mob Loot

When a [refractor](../entities/refractor) is killed there is a small chance (8.5%) of dropping a magical scepte; 
the drop rate increases by 1% per level of Looting: 9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III. 

## Usage

### Casting

Each [scepter](../scepters/scepters) variant has two ways to cast a [spell](../spells/spells); 
either attack with the item to cast the attack spell or use the item to cast the protect spell.
In order to cast a spell the [scepter](../scepters/scepters) requires the player to have enough [experience](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Experience) to cast a spell.
When a spell is being cast a cooldown will be imposed on the use of any magical scepter with a duration based on the [spell](../spells/spells).

### Durability

Casting a spell costs 1 [durability](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Durability). 
When the item breaks it will be replaced by a [scepter](scepter), which can be crafted back into a magical scepter. 
The [scepter](scepter) will keep the enchantments of the broken magical scepter, but it will lose the possible infusion.

## Enchantments

[Unbreaking](), [mending]() and [curse of vanishing]() are compatible with the magical scepter.

### Insight

An unique enchantment called 'insight' can also be put on the magical scepter and causes mobs to drop more experience when killed.
The insight enchantment can be obtained by villagers and on books in the enchanting table. 
The maximum level of the enchantment is three and the experience dropped is modified with the following distribution.

| Level | Modifier |
| ----- | ----- |
| I     | 130% |
| II    | 165% |
| III   | 200% |
