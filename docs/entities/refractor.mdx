a refractor is an illager that wields a [magical scepter](../items/magical_scepter) to cast spells for offense and defense.

## Spawning

A refractor may spawn in the Overworld above opaque blocks at a light level of 0 in all biomes except for mushroom fields and deep dark. Refractors always spawn individually. Refractors are the only mobs that can spawn in the small area around an old taiga cabin.

Old taiga cabins spawn a refractor inside during world generation that will never despawn.

Refractors spawn as parts of raids starting from wave 4. From wave 6 refractors can spawn riding ravagers, creating a refractor ravager jockey.
