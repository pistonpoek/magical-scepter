Stability is a [status effect](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Effect) that reduces the effects from [knockback](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Knockback_(mechanic)) for the affected entity.
The effect is caused by using the [warden scepter](../scepters/warden_scepter).
For each level of stability the affected entity gets 30% less knockback, including from explosions.
Level IV or higher means that the entity is not affected by knockback.
