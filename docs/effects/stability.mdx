Stability is a [status effect](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Effect) that negates explosion damage and reduces the effects from [knockback](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Knockback_(mechanic)) for the affected entity.


## Effect

All damage from explosions is ignored and for each level of stability the affected entity gets 30% less knockback, including from explosions.
Level IV or higher means that the entity is not affected by knockback.


## Causes

The effect is caused by using the [warden scepter](../scepters/warden_scepter).


## Advancements

The stability effect is required for the ['How Did We Get Here?'](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Advancement_guide/Nether_tab#How_Did_We_Get_Here?) advancement.
