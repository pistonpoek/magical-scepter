Repulsion is a [status effect](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Effect) that protects the affected entity from non magical projectiles.
The effect is caused by using the [wither scepter](../scepters/wither_scepter).
While the effect protects against [arrows](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Arrow) and [tridents](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Trident) like a shield, 
it will not protect from the explosions and effects of [firework rockets](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Firework_Rocket) and other projectiles.
